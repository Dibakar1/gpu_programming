# gpu_programming
In this repository, I will be developing some basic signal processing/algebraic kernels which can be executed only on NVIDIA GPUs and support numba cuda and pycuda libraries. The purpose of maintaining this repo is to showcase the parallel processing capability of GPGPUs (General Purpose Graphic Processing Units) in implementing complex algorithms. I will be comparing the compute/execution time of various signal processing/algebraic algorithms on CPU vs GPU.
